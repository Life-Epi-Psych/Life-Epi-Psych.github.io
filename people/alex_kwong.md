# Dr Alex Kwong

I am a Wellcome Senior Research Fellow at the Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences.
 
I completed my PhD in Advanced Quantitative Methods at the University of Bristol in 2019. I joined Psychiatry as a Research Fellow shortly.
 
I am interested in examining the causes and consequences of poorer mental health in young people. My research group uses longitudinal data through the lens of epidemiology, genomics, data science and social science to probe this. We are also interested in developing methods that can facilitate better understanding of the course of mental health problems.
 
I was awarded an ESRC Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2020 examining bio-psycho-social mechanisms underpinning adolescent depression & then awarded two Wellcome Mental Health Data Prizes in 2022 and 2023 to develop a digital tool TIDAL (Tool to Implement Developmental Analysis of Longitudinal Data) .In 2024, I started a 5-year Wellcome Early Career Award that combines these research interests above and joined the Edinburgh Scientific Academic Track (ESAT) scheme, which is a tenure track scheme for early career scientists at Edinburgh.
 
Outside of work, I’m very into making my own music (lo-fi, pop-punk, metal), albeit all terribly.
