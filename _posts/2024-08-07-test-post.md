We are pleased to present TIDAL: Tool to Implement Developmental Analysis of Longitudinal Data. TIDAL can be found here: [https://tidal-modelling.github.io/](https://tidal-modelling.github.io/), with the corresponding preprint found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.12.24311854v1).

TIDAL can easily create trajectories of longitudinal data for you, online or either in the recommended R package. It will create plots for you and help you interpret some of your results.

We have tested TIDAL on many datasets including ALPSAC, MCS, TEDS, Pelotas 2004, GUS, ABCD and UK Biobank. TIDAL uses the lme4 package to estimate multilevel growth curve models.
