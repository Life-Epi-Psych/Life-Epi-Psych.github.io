We are pleased to present TIDAL: Tool to Implement Developmental Analysis of Longitudinal Data, a free and easy tool to access, analyse and interpret trajectory data. A preprint of the manuscript can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.12.24311854v1).

TIDAL has been developed with prospective users and people with lived experience of mental health. It is a joint effort with collaborators from King's College London, University of Bristol and Manchester Metropolitan University. TIDAL was funded by Wellcome as part of the Wellcome Mental Health Data Prize.

For more information, including detailed guides on how to download, install and use TIDAL, please see the documention website at [https://tidal-modelling.github.io/](https://tidal-modelling.github.io/).
