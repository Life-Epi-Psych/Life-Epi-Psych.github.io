# Lifecourse Epidemiology and Psychiatry Research Group (LEAP)

## We are a research group based within the University of Edinburgh, interested in all things longitudinal data, psychiatry and epidemiology related. 

We are interested in examining the causes and consequences of poorer health, society and social functioning, mostly from the lens of mental health over time. We use a longitudinal bio-psycho-social approach incorporating statistics, psychology, epidemiology, public health and genetics into our work. Check out the Research tab to see what current themes we are working on. 

We use data from longitudinal cohort studies such as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, UK Biobank, Generation Scotland and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. 

We are also interested in methods development to better facilitate access to longitudinal data and longitudinal methods.

We are always looking to expand so if you're interested in joining our group as an intern, MSc student, PhD student or Postdoc, or collaborating with us, then please feel free to reach out through the Contact tab.  

Our group is mainly funded by Wellcome, but we also receive funding from the Medical Research Council and the Economic Social Research Council in the past.
